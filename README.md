# Vue Cleanup

## Taylor Plewe, July 2022

Checks your Vue file for any unused variables, data members, computed properties, methods, and CSS classes.  Also checks for miscellaneous styling errors (incorrect whitespace etc.) and lists all comments and TODOs in the file. <br />
<br />
Data updates every time you save the .vue file OR whenever you switch between files.
